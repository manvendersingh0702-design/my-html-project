                <h2>
                    We have ‘lost’ India and Russia to ‘dark china’, says Donald Trump
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On Thursday, Mr. Trump wrote a post accusing his Chinese counterpart of “conspiring” against USA along with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and Russia’s Vladimir Putin, who were the chief guests of China’s event to commemorate 80 years since the end of World War II. “China’s development of diplomatic relations with any country is never directed against any third party,” the nation’s spokesperson.

Recently, Mr. Trump’s top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, called the bonhomie between the three leader as “troublesome” and added Mr. Modi needs to be with Washington, Europe and Ukraine, not with Russia.

While the Ministry of External Affairs declined to comment on Mr. Trump’s TruthSocial post, the Ministry’s spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “We have seen the inaccurate and misleading statements made by Mr. Navarro, and obviously reject them.“

                        Dravid’s parting of ways with Rajasthan Royals, and beyond

                        There really is no place for sentiment in sport, it would appear. Under Erik ten Hag, Manchester United won the FA Cup and the League Cup, yet the Dutchman was sacked by the troubled one-time English giants in October 2024. He subsequently moved to Bayer Leverkusen in the German Bundesliga at the start of this season, but his tenure lasted a mere two league fixtures.
